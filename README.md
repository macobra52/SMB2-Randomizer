# SMB2-Randomizer
by MaCobra52

This is a randomizer for Super Mario Bros 2 (US) that includes the following core options:

-Character Randomizer - modifies the game so that in each level you are locked into selecting one character chosen at random. The character is automatically highlighted and you cannot use left/right to change them.

-Level Randomizer - Shuffles the level order (except for 7-2, which is always last). Additional options are also included to customize the level randomization, modify warp functionality, and randomize most plants that you pull from the ground.

-Enemy/Boss Randomizer - Randomizes most enemies (notable exception being Cobrats and Pokeys due to their uniqueness), Pansers, Sparks, the small jars that generate enemies, Birdos, Birdo pattern, and the HP of major bosses.


First Time Instructions:

Ensure that you have Java 8 or later installed on your machine prior to running. If needed you can download from the link below:
https://www.java.com/en/

1. Double-click the exe to start the randomizer.
2. Select the base SMB2U ROM (PRG0 or PRG1/Rev A) that you would like to use along with the output directory of the randomized ROM.
3. Enter a number for the seed, or use the one provided.
4. If you wish to adjust any of the settings, adjust the appropriate options on each tab. You can randomize character choice, levels, plants, enemies, Birdo, boss hp, set starting lives, continues, health, change character colors, and more!
5. click 'Generate!'

At this point you can close the randomizer and play! The randomizer will remember the previous files, directories, and settings chosen, so in the future all you need to do is adjust the seed (if desired) and click 'Generate!'


Notes:

-The base ROM selected should be a clean PRG0 or PRG1/Rev A SMB2U ROM. The randomizer will let you use other ROMS, but there are no guarantees that it will work succesfully.

-If you are planning a race, be sure that all participants enter the same seed and flags to generate the same randomization. Additionally a hash will be displayed on the title screen (in place of the copyright) and included in the file name to confirm that everything matches. With the exception of the character color, graphics, and music options present, hashes will NOT match if a different seed or different settings are chosen.

-With enemy randomization, there may be difficult/unfair scenarios that can occur, but care has been taken where necessary to prevent softlocks and being forced to take damage to progress. Additionally a Speedrun Friendly option exists that does not randomize certain additional enemies that are used during a typical speedrun of the game.

Special Thanks To:
